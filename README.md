# SystemAnalysis

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a company that wishes to capitalize on the market of helping new drivers prepare for their driving exams before actually taking them at the DMV. The client is who will be the main admin of the system, he is the owner of the company and oversee everything on the site. They wanted me to design a system that would serve as the main hub for scheduling, organizing, and providing feedback between the client, costumer, and the DMV.

What did you do particularly well?
I think my dtrongest point was the activities diagrams and organize the work. I had a really rocky start but once I found traction it came better to me than the other steps.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I'm pretty bad with UML diagrams, I'd like to improve my class chart skills and UML skills in general.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took into account how to at least get as many functions the costumer wanted to at least function in its most basic form. They wanted a mobile version as well, I couldn't see a relable way to do everything for that as well, so I made sure it would at least work on the base destop version. It is important to take the user's needs in mind as it doesn't matter how fancy, or well designed a system you make is, if no one can use it is pointless.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I break down the request down and find the requirments to meet them to see which ones will be easier, which ones will be harder, and which ones will be imposible. After that, take all that info and organize it based off the given timeline and budget. I like the use of the gant chart, it was a really nice, visual way to start to organize things.
